# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection System

🚀 Machine Learning-based system to detect fraudulent credit card transactions with an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning system designed to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.
It uses a trained classification model along with an interactive Streamlit web application to predict whether a transaction is **fraudulent or legitimate** in real time.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Credit card fraud is a critical issue in the financial industry.
Fraudulent transactions are **very rare compared to normal transactions**, making this an **imbalanced classification problem**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

* Detect fraudulent transactions accurately
* Minimize false negatives (missed fraud cases)
* Build a user-friendly ML-powered interface
* Demonstrate a real-world machine learning pipeline

---

## 🧠 Solution Approach

### 🔹 Data Processing

* Loaded transaction dataset
* Performed preprocessing and scaling
* Handled class imbalance using `class_weight="balanced"`

### 🔹 Model

* Random Forest Classifier
* Optimized for performance and speed

### 🔹 Features

* PCA-transformed features (V1–V28)
* Transaction Amount and Time

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Streamlit
* Joblib

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* Fraud prediction with confidence score
* Auto-load real transaction samples (Normal / Fraud / Random)
* Actual vs Predicted comparison
* Feature importance visualization
* Class distribution graph
* Interactive input interface
* Pre-trained model loading (no retraining required)
